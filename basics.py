print ("C:\narray") 
here the desired output we want is C:\narray but we got 
C:
array
this is because \n is an escape character which creates a new line
so to resolve this we will write print ("C:\\narray") 
'''
print("C:\\narry")
# similarly we cannot print like this ->print("C:"harry")->this is wrong
# print("C:"harry") output an error so to correct it we will use an escape sequence character(\)
